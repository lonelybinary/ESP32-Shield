  Lonely Binary Digtial Mic ESP32 Shield

  The Lonely Binary Wireless WiFi Microphone Shield is an advanced audio solution featuring the INMP441 I2S digital microphone. This high-fidelity microphone module captures crystal-clear audio, making it an excellent choice for DIY enthusiasts looking to construct devices such as baby monitors or custom WiFi microphone systems.

  Designed for seamless integration with WiFi-enabled devices, the shield utilizes the INMP441â€™s superior sensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio to deliver pristine sound quality. The microphone operates with I2S digital output, which ensures lossless audio transmission and easy interfacing with processors and microcontrollers.

  Ideal for a range of applications, from home surveillance to personal audio systems, this shield provides developers with the tools to create professional-grade audio devices. Its straightforward setup and robust performance make it a versatile and valuable component for any project requiring reliable and high-quality sound capture.

  PC Client:
  Google Chrome
  VLC (Low Latency)

  Troubleshooting:
  If there is strong background noise, you may add a 10K ohm resistor to pull down pin 32 to the ground (GND). This modification should help in reducing the noise interference effectively.
  (pin 32) --- (10k resistor) --- GND
