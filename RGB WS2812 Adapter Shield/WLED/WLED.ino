WLED is an open-source project that allows users to control addressable RGB LEDs, such as WS2812, via Wi-Fi. It runs on ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers, providing an easy-to-use web interface, app integration, and support for numerous lighting effects and customizations.

WLED includes a built-in web interface and apps for both Android and iPhone, allowing you to use it without writing any code.

Website: https://kno.wled.ge/

Installation:
1, Plug in your ESP32 and visit https://install.wled.me/.
2, Choose the latest release version and select the "Plain" version.
3, Click "Install." A serial port selection window should pop up. Choose the serial port connected to your ESP32 board and follow the prompts to install WLED.
4, After installation, you will be prompted to enter your local Wi-Fi details to connect the ESP32 to your network.
5, Go to the iPhone App Store and install the "WLED-Native" app; the app should automatically detect the local ESP32 with the WLED firmware.
6, Click "Config," then "LED Preferences," and set GPIO and WS2812 Length.
7, Enjoy!
